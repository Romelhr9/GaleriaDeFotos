Acts as the wrapper for the consistent parts of the website on 
every page.

So far we’ve created two specific views for our website, one for the 
home page and one for the details of an image. However, there’s no 
consistent UI wrapping both of these pages together. We have no 
consistent navigation or logo. There’s no common footer with
standard copyright or additional information.

Usually, with any website that you create, you’re going to want to 
have some form of a standard layout or master template that every 
page will use. This layout typically includes the website logo and 
title, main navigation, sidebar (if any), and the footer. It would be
bad practice to include the HTML code for the layout in every single 
page on our website because if we wanted to make even the smallest 
change to the main layout, we would have to edit every single page as 
a result. Fortunately, Handlebars helps lessen the work of
utilizing a layout file.
