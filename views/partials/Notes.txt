Are really just small views that we can reuse and inject inside our 
layouts or views.

Partials are a terrific way to create reusable components in your 
website and reduce code duplication. Consider the comments in our 
application. 

We have an HTML form defined that a user uses to submit 
a comment, but what if we wanted to allow users to post comments from 
a number of different areas throughout the website.

This type of scenario is a great candidate for moving our comment 
form out to its own partial and then just including that partial 
anywhere we want to display the comment form.

For this app, we’re using partials specifically for the sidebar in 
the main layout. With every view’s ViewModel, we will include a 
JavaScript object called  sidebar that will contain the data 
specifically for the stats, popular images, and recent comments 
found within the sidebar partial.

Let’s create the HTML for each of the partials.
