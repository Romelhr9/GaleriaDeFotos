
The HTML in the following section relies heavily on Bootstrap, a 
popular HTML framework created by Twitter that provides a standard set
of user interface elements. These include buttons, fonts, layout 
grids, color schemes, and a whole lot more. Using Bootstrap allows us 
to not only present our application with a nice clean UI, but also 
build it so that it is responsive and will look correct on any device 
that is viewing it.
